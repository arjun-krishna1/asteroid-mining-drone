# Asteroid Mining Drone
- Why waste human time to identify and mine asteroids when drones can do it for us?
- This way we can spend our time doing ore important things... like playing minecraft ...
- simulating an Asteroid Mining Drone in Unity
- implementing asteroid identification and classification algorithms in Python using OpenCV and Tensorflow

## DONE
- generate asteroids of different types in random locations in unity
- write scripts to output images from Unity camera to a directory

## TODO
- remove all colours from images except for red and blue
- add functionality to take rotation of drone when image was taken and predict asteroid location
- build to WebGL and add to portfolio website
